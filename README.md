# VariousPlugins
### Contains various plugins for a Minecraft Server I was working on

## Notes
This was my first time coding in Java (this was back in early 2020). 
As such, this code is really really bad. But it shows where I came from 
and shows the immense amount of improvement I've made in my coding skills since. 
I'm always excited for what the future has in store and seeing
my abilities as a programmer continuously improve.
